# Automatic-Railway-Gate
This project is an Automatic railway gate at a level crossing and its primary purpose is to replace the gates operated manually by the gatekeeper to reduce and avoid accidents by detecting the arrival of the train using sensors placed near the gate that greatly reduced the operating response time.
