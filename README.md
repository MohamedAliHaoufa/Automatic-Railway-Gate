# Automatic-Railway-Gate
This project involves the development of an automatic railway gate system at level crossings. Its primary objective is to replace manually operated gates, improving safety and eciency by reducing human error. The system uses sensors placed near the gate to detect oncoming trains, signicantly decreasing the response time and minimizing the risk of accidents.
